This a web-based Serious Game. It is designed to demonstrate the criticality of water circular economy in modern societies, especially in areas that face water scarcity problems and are decentralized as to the broader network. 

The player is requested to take matters into his own hands and resolve the town's water management issues, via exploring alternative methods to exploit the incoming rainwater.
